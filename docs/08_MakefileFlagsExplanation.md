### **Explanation of Key Makefile Commands**

In the Makefile, certain commands and variables are used to streamline the build process. Below is a detailed explanation of the specific commands and variables you asked about:

---

### **1. `-c $< -o $@`**

#### **Command:**
```make
$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@
```

#### **Explanation:**
This command is used to compile a source file (e.g., `.cpp`) into an object file (e.g., `.o`).

- **`-c`**:
  - Instructs the compiler to compile the source file into an object file without linking.
  - This step translates the human-readable code into machine-readable code but doesn’t produce an executable yet.

- **`$<`**:
  - Refers to the first dependency of the target in a Makefile rule.
  - For example, in this rule:
    ```make
    simple_test.o: tests/simple_test.cpp
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@
    ```
    `$<` is `tests/simple_test.cpp`.

- **`-o $@`**:
  - Specifies the output file name for the compilation.
  - `$@` refers to the target in the Makefile rule.
  - For example, in the same rule:
    ```make
    simple_test.o: tests/simple_test.cpp
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@
    ```
    `$@` is `simple_test.o`.

#### **Summary:**
The command compiles `tests/simple_test.cpp` (denoted by `$<`) into an object file named `simple_test.o` (denoted by `$@`).

---

### **2. `-pthread -o $@`**

#### **Command:**
```make
$(CXX) gtest-all.o gtest-main.o simple_test.o -pthread -o $@
```

#### **Explanation:**
This command is used to link multiple object files into a single executable.

- **Object Files (`gtest-all.o`, `gtest-main.o`, `simple_test.o`)**:
  - These are compiled object files that need to be linked together into an executable.

- **`-pthread`**:
  - Enables support for multithreading using POSIX threads.
  - Google Test requires threading support because it uses threads internally for certain features (e.g., test case isolation).
  - Without this flag, you may encounter linker errors.

- **`-o $@`**:
  - Specifies the output file name for the linking step.
  - `$@` refers to the target in the Makefile rule.
  - For example, in this rule:
    ```make
    todo_tests: gtest-all.o gtest-main.o simple_test.o
        $(CXX) gtest-all.o gtest-main.o simple_test.o -pthread -o $@
    ```
    `$@` is `todo_tests`.

#### **Summary:**
The command links `gtest-all.o`, `gtest-main.o`, and `simple_test.o` into an executable named `todo_tests`, with threading support enabled via `-pthread`.

### **3. `INCLUDES = -I$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest/include -I$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest -I$(SRC_DIR)`**

#### **Command:**
```make
INCLUDES = -I$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest/include -I$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest -I$(SRC_DIR)
```

#### **Explanation:**
This variable defines include paths for header files that are required during compilation.

- **`-I<path>`**:
  - Adds a directory to the list of paths that the compiler searches for header files (`#include <...>`).
  - If you don’t specify these paths, the compiler won’t be able to find certain headers and will throw errors like "file not found."

#### Paths Explained:
1. **`$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest/include`:**
   - Points to Google Test’s public headers (e.g., `<gtest/gtest.h>`).
   - Required for including Google Test functionality in your test files.

2. **`$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest`:**
   - Points to Google Test’s internal headers and source files (e.g., `src/gtest-all.cc`, which includes other internal headers).
   - Required because we are building Google Test from source.

3. **`$(SRC_DIR)`**:
   - Points to your project’s application headers (e.g., `ui.h`, `todo.h`).
   - Ensures that your test files can include application-specific headers.

#### Usage in Compilation Command:
The `INCLUDES` variable is used in compilation commands like this:
```make
$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@
```
This ensures that all necessary header files can be found during compilation.

#### **Summary:**
The `INCLUDES` variable specifies where the compiler should look for header files during compilation. It includes paths for:
1. Google Test’s public headers (`include/`).
2. Google Test’s internal headers (`googletest/`).
3. Your project’s application headers (`src/`).

### Putting It All Together

Here’s how these commands work together in your Makefile:

1. Compile a source file into an object file:
   ```make
   simple_test.o: tests/simple_test.cpp
       $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@
   ```
   This compiles `tests/simple_test.cpp`, using header files from paths specified in `INCLUDES`, and outputs an object file named `simple_test.o`.

2. Link object files into an executable:
   ```make
   todo_tests: gtest-all.o gtest-main.o simple_test.o
       $(CXX) gtest-all.o gtest-main.o simple_test.o -pthread -o $@
   ```
   This links all required object files (`gtest-all.o`, `gtest-main.o`, and `simple_test.o`) into a test executable named `todo_tests`, enabling threading support with `-pthread`.

3. Include paths for finding headers:
   ```make
   INCLUDES = -I$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest/include -I$(EXTERNAL_DIR)/googletest -I$(SRC_DIR)
   ```
   Ensures that all necessary header files (Google Test + application-specific headers) are accessible during compilation.

### Summary of Commands

| Command                         | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-c $< -o $@`                   | Compiles a source file (`$<`) into an object file (`$@`).               |
| `-pthread -o $@`                | Links object files into an executable (`$@`) with threading support.   |
| `INCLUDES = ...`                | Specifies include paths for header files during compilation.           |

These commands work together in your Makefile to build both application and test executables efficiently while ensuring all dependencies are handled correctly. Let me know if you need further clarification!
